  		<h3>Hi. I'm Brett.</h3>
  		<p>
  			I'm a designer and engineer.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			I've tried many hats...
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			As a young sprite, I bagged groceries and herded carts into their corrals.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Once I hit college, I spent a lot of time around the elderly.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			For a brief stint, I was a custodian at my town's local library.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			I was a tutor for some great kids.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Then I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Namibia.
  			For 26 months, I was a math teacher.
  			I extended my service for a year.
  			For the next 13 months, I developed teaching materials and collaborated with NIED staff and JICA volunteers to design the Information and Communication (IC) curriculum.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Next, I moved to Washington, D.C.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			And became a Research Assistant at the United States Census Bureau.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Where I design and develop interactive data visualizations and write R and Python code to build simulations and conduct data analysis.
  		</p>

  		<h3>The Future</h3>
  		<p>
  			I love computer science. (Fingers crossed that graduate school is in my near future!)
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			And people (though I'm usually quiet or shy).
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			And data... Data and visual encodings are my clay.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			I want to use technology to help people unlock their potential.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			And to augment our abilities.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Especially compassion and empathy.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			I think habits are key.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Think we'd work well together? Send me an email.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Oh, and if you're curious about my website's name, check out the <a href="http://www.kiphlora.com/kla">Kiphlora Learning Adventure</a> project in my portfolio. :-)

		<!-- <p>Hi. I'm Brett.</p>
		<p>People my passion. Data are my clay. Technology are my tools. Unlocking potential is my dream. Let's become the best versions of ourselves... together.</p>

		<p>You may be interested to learn that the name of the website, Kiphlora, came from a project I developed while teaching in Namibia. I had spent nearly two years teaching Mathematics to sixth-grade children in a small village named Bethanie. Teaching was hard. Teaching IS hard. And, to these kids, math was difficult and a little boring. It was hard for them to relate to the concepts, even when put into contexts with which they were famililar. I decided to try something a bit more radical: I wanted to make a game for them; a learning adventure to engage them in the subject matter.</p>
		<p>The result was Kiphlora, a fictional world of short stories and quests aimed at engaging the students and providing them with applications of math connected to the stories. You can read more about the Kiphlora Learning Adventure on my portfolio page.</p>

		<p>My journey is as follows:</p>

		<p>I grew up in Kansas.</p>
		<p>Received my B.S. in Mathematics and Philosophy, and minor in Computer Science at Kansas State University (2004-2011).</p>
		<p>Volunteered as a teacher, teaching material developer, and curriculum consultant in Namibia with the United States Peace Corps (2011-2014).</p>
		<p>Work as a Research Specialist at the United States Census Bureau (2014-Present).</p>

		<p>I'm interested in many things. Here is a sample of them:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Personalization - I want to create systems that use peoples' personal data to help them make better choices for themselves.</li>
			<li>Generative Systems - I want to develop systems that can create novel content for users.</li>
			<li>Internet of Things and Sensors - As computers become more fully integrated into our everyday lives, we can use these technologies to help us become our best selves.</li>
			<li>Perspectives - The ways in which we view the world are varied. Each person has a perspective on their environment that has been molded over a lifetime by experience. With these views, we can discover why people make certain decisions, behave differently, and, most importantly, how to empathize with them.</li>
			<li>Sensory mapping and Visualization - I love looking at new representations of data. Some encodings are more useful than others, but most sensory mappings are interesting to experience, regardless of utility.</li>
		</ul>
